This project was made in the context of the **Machine Learning** course from the Faculty of Sciences of the University of Lisbon. 

The used [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/momohmustapha/donorsprediction/) includes information on donors who financially contributed to the National Veterans Organization.

This project consisted of two main tasks:
* **Task 1** (Supervised Learning) - Predicting if a person is a potential donor (**binary classification**) and what would be the value range of their donation (**multiclass classification**);
* **Task 2** (Unsupervised Learning) - Characterizing groups of donors with similar characteristics (**clustering and association rule mining**).
